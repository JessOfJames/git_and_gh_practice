I like to read. I lost my ability to read for a few months after a car accident last year. I hadn't spent much time reading for the past 10-15 years because I lost my enjoyment of it during an English Lit degree, analyze the shit out the most mundane parts of these stories, then write dull nonsense about it. But now, after not being able to read for a while, I'm reading books that I've had on my shelf for while. The Harry Potter series, Never Let Me Go, The War of Art, and Cloud Atlas will be a big part of my rest and relaxation time during the Turing experience.
